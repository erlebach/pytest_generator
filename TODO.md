# TODO Tasks to improve pytest_generator

- (2025-01-21): run an initialization script that copies and modifies certain files in the parent folder. 
  Example: run_tests.x should be updated with the new due date
- (2025-01-21): There should a test configuration file with a `due_date1` attribute. Ideally, the due 
  date could be read from Gradescope to avoid inconsistencies. 
- (2025-01-21): copy (from parent folder), the homework definition file(s)
- (2025-01-21): copy from parent folder the contents of instructor_with_answers/ and student_with_answers/
- (2025-01-21): Make sure that all the files in tests/ are uploaded to grading repository. Perhaps in update.x? 

Make sure structure works for homework 2. 
Make sure answers work for homework 2.
Update all_questions.py to make sure that questions in python code are consistent 
  and clear. 
Make sure that choices for strings are clearly stated.
