# Tasks to improve pytest_generator

- (2025-01-21): run an initialization script that copies and modifies certain files in the parent folder. 
  Example: run_tests.x should be updated with the new due date
- (2025-01-21): There should a test configuration file with a `due_date1` attribute. Ideally, the due 
  date could be read from Gradescope to avoid inconsistencies. 
- (2025-01-21): copy (from parent folder), the homework definition file(s)
- (2025-01-21): copy from parent folder the contents of instructor_with_answers/ and student_with_answers/
