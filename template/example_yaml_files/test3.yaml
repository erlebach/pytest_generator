# Without fixtures, read from instructor file

# Some tests fail, some succeed. This allows me to see how Gradescope shows the tests that pass and fail to the students
# Some tests have incorrect values and some incorrect structure
# Generate an expanded file with one id per 'answer' in the 'answers' key. 
# Run the expanded file through the regular generator. 
# I wonder if I should separate the correct answer from the incorrect ones.
